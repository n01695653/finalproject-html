                        projects, and contact information. Built using HTML, the website features a clean and simple
                        design,
                        with a homepage, bio page, project showcase, and contact information. Each page demonstrates
                        foundational web development concepts,includes image slideshows, forms, and navigation menus.
                        The
                        interactive elements provide users with an engaging browsing experience, making it easy to
                        explore
                        my background and connect with me. This portfolio will serve as an ongoing repository for future
                        projects and skills as I progress in my career.

                    <p class="project-dis">This project is a static Recipe Book website built using HTML. It showcases a
                        collection of my favorite recipes, each with detailed ingredients, preparation steps, and
                        serving suggestions. The site includes images of the dishes for visual appeal and easy
                        reference. Additionally, each recipe features a link to a related YouTube video for further
                        guidance. The design emphasizes simplicity and user-friendliness, allowing easy navigation
                        between recipes. This project highlights my ability to organize content using HTML, incorporate
                        images, and integrate external links, creating an interactive and engaging cooking experience
                        for users.
